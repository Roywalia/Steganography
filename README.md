# Steganography
#### This project provides a simple Python-based steganography tool that allows users to encode and decode secret messages within image files. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter


## Features
1. Encode Messages in Images
   * Upload an image, type a secret message, and embed it into the image using the "Encode" functionality.
   * Save the new image with the hidden message.
2. Decode Messages from Images
   * Upload an image with a hidden message, and reveal the message using the "Decode" functionality.


## How It Works
### Encoding Process:
  1. Click the Encode button.
  2. Select an image file (.png, .jpeg, or .jpg).
  3. Enter the secret message you want to hide.
  4. Press Encode.  
    The program will create a new image file with the message embedded.

### Decoding Process:
  1. Click the Decode button.
  2. Select an image file that contains a hidden message.
  3. The hidden message will be displayed in the text box.
